## Software

While a Windows Form Application was used for presentation purposes to showcase the software's capabilities, the top layer of the project can be easily replaced with an MVC or Web API project, thanks to its flexible structure and the proper implementation of the open-closed principle.

The software essentially provides a calorie tracking module. Additionally, a water consumption tracker and various other modules, such as recipe collections, could also be easily integrated, thanks to followed best practices.

In adherence to the Solid principles, it was developed with the n-tier architecture. Customized exceptions have also been included to allow using of different projects at the top layer. There is a constants folder which is designed to centralize configurations and prevent the occurrence of magic string issues.
